# What and How to Contribute

**Contribute Missing and Corrected Links**

It is invaluable yet impossible to maintain current, complete and correct compilations of content and links to relevant information available on the web (publications, events, apps, data, services, etc). 

Please contribute links to missing information, whether the links help fill gaps or expand the scope of information resources currently linked to.  When you contribute new links, at minumum please include the URL and the name of the resource and if possible, also a short neutral summary of the resource is also very useful.

Likewise, if you discover problems with existing links (whether the link is broken, leads to the wrong location or leads to an outdated version of information, etc) please contribute corrections or updates.

**Contribute New Content**

We also welcome totally new content, such as documents, sofware, data, media, etc. provided the contribution is relevant and covered by Open Source or Creative Commons license. 

We don't necessarily publish all content but appreciate the opportunity to consider whether it is a good fit for our growing collection.  Very large collections of content or data are probably not appropriate to host and publish here.  If you are uncertain, just pose the questions (see below on how to do that).  If you'd like to share content but it isn't a good fit here, consider publishing it at a free, open content repository such as Archive.org and then contribute a link to the content here.  


**How Do I Contribute New or Edited Content?**

To propose contributions of new or edited content, just grab a free GitHub account and make a ["pull request"](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) and if it's a good fit, we will [merge](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request) the contribution to make it part of our repository. 

**Share Questions and Ideas**

Question that occur to you while exploring can be a very constructive contribution.  If you have the question, there is a reasonable chance others do too and good questions are valuable whether or not there is a direct answer available.  

Likewise, you are welcome to share your own observations about emerging themes/trends/etc or insights about important unsolved challenges and other ideas.  

**How Do I Pose Questions and Ideas?**

The best way to share your questions, ideas and other comments is by creating an ["issue"](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues).  Adding the most relevant [label(s)](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests) to your issue can make it much easier to discover, understand and address.
